Between then and the 6th June 2020, 33,846\\npeople died and the total number of cases rose to 234,801 [8].\\n23.3% of Italy’s population is over the age of 65 [5], making it\\nthe second oldest population in the world. This may explain\\nwhy Italy seems especially vulnerable. I have modelled Italy’s\\noutbreak using SIRD modelling. Modelling accurate rates of\\ninfection, recovery and death, along with the basic reproduc-\\ntion number, R0, can be quite challenging due to the high\\nproportion of infections that are undetected. The number of\\ninfections has been estimated to be as high as 63 times as large\\nas the number recorded [3].\\nSIRD Modelling\\nSIRD modelling is based on four diﬀerent groups within the\\npopulation: those who are susceptible (S); those who are in-\\nfected (I); those who have recovered (R); and those who have\\ndied (D).\\nThe governing equations of my model are as follows:\\nS + I\\nβ\\n−→2I\\nI\\nγ\\n−→R\\nI\\nδ\\n−→D\\nWhere β is the contact rate, γ is the rate of recovery, and δ is\\nthe rate of death. From these equations, the following system\\nof ODEs can be found and solved [6]:\\ndS\\ndt = −β\\nNSI\\ndI\\ndt = β\\nNSI −(γ + δ)I\\ndR\\ndt = γI\\ndD\\ndt = δI\\nFitting the Model to the Data\\nI used least squares regression from python’s lmﬁt module to\\nﬁt my SIRD model to my data [7]. I began by assuming that\\nmy rates β, γ and δ were all constant. However, after plotting\\nthe results of this model, I quickly realised that my value of β\\nneeded to decrease with time. Therefore, I decided to deﬁne\\nβ(t) as a function instead. I found this function intuitively\\nusing a negative exponential model multiplied by the β value\\nfound. I also assumed that the initial number of susceptible in\\nItaly was equal to the population: 60,461,828 [1]. The results\\nfor recovery and death rates were as follows:\\nγ = 0.0234\\nδ = 0.0064\\nThe following values of β correspond to the start of the data\\nand the end of lockdown:\\n18/02/2020\\nβ = 0.1473\\n14/05/2020\\nβ = 0.0080\\nFrom these values of β we can see that at the end of lockdown,\\nthe infection rate was much lower, as expected, due to much\\nfewer contacts between those in the susceptible group and those\\nin the infected group.\\nR0\\nAn important feature of modelling epidemics is the basic repro-\\nduction number R0. This number is the number of secondary\\ninfections resulting from a single primary infection. The reason\\nthis value is so important is that it is an indication of whether\\nthe disease will die out (R0 \\< 1), or if it will become an en-\\ndemic (R0 \\> 1) [4]. This value changes when measures are\\nimplemented that reduce the rate of infection, like lockdown.\\nR0 can be found using the following equation [7]:\\nR0 = β(t)\\nγ\\nUsing my model, I have found values of R0 at diﬀerent times:\\n18/02/2020\\nR0 = 6.2929\\n22/04/2020\\nR0 = 1.0052\\n23/04/2020\\nR0 = 0.9542\\n14/05/2020\\nR0 = 0.3405\\nR0 is ﬁrst below 1, meaning that the disease has begun dying\\nout, on the 23rd April 2020, in the middle of the lockdown pe-\\nriod. This suggests that lockdown was eﬀective. When Italy\\nbegan relaxing its lockdown measures, R0 was very small, how-\\never as the lockdown eases and contact rates increase that value\\ncould easily rise once again.\\nAssumptions\\nSIRD modelling has many drawbacks. First of all, the assumes that once you have been infected you are then immune to the virus,\\nwhich has not been proved or disproved for coronavirus yet. If this assumption is proved wrong, the model would be unreliable\\nuntil another category is added in. My model assumes that you become infectious when you become infected (i.e. when you test\\npositive), however, according to Harvard Medical School [2], you actually become infectious up to 72 hours before you show any\\nsymptoms. Another assumption is that there are no births in the population. There are also problems with the accuracy and\\nreliability of the data [8] being used. Many cases of coronavirus go unreported and untested. There could also be a high proportion\\nof asymptomatic cases [3], which will also remain unrecorded.\\nThe Model\\nFigure 1:Data vs Model plotted between 18/02/2020 and 07/06/2020\\nForecast\\nFigure 2:Model plotted between 18/02/2020 and 06/08/2020\\nConclusion\\nAlthough I do not believe that the model I have gener-\\nated is very accurate, it seems that Italy is very much on\\nthe way towards eradicating coronavirus. However, the un-\\nknown proportion of the population that has coronavirus\\nand is asymptomatic, along with the unrecorded cases,\\ncould mean that we may begin to see an upward trend\\nin the number of cases. Potentially even a second peak.\\nGoing forward, I would like to add in more compartments\\ninto my model (such as the exposed compartment), in order\\nto increase the accuracy of the model. This exposed cate-\\ngory would remove the need for a dampener on the rate of\\ninfection, as a contact rate would then also be estimated,\\nmaking a much more reliable model. I would also like to\\ncompare various countries which have now left lockdown\\nin order to see how exiting the lockdown has aﬀected their\\ninfection rates and whether a second spike seems likely.\\nReferences\\n[1] “Our world in data coronavirus.” [Online].

Between then and the 6th June 2020, 33,846\\\\npeople died and the total number of cases rose to 234,801 [8].\\\\n23.3% of Italy’s population is over the age of 65 [5], making it\\\\nthe second oldest population in the world. This may explain\\\\nwhy Italy seems especially vulnerable. I have modelled Italy’s\\\\noutbreak using SIRD modelling. Modelling accurate rates of\\\\ninfection, recovery and death, along with the basic reproduc-\\\\ntion number, R0, can be quite challenging due to the high\\\\nproportion of infections that are undetected. The number of\\\\ninfections has been estimated to be as high as 63 times as large\\\\nas the number recorded [3].\\\\nSIRD Modelling\\\\nSIRD modelling is based on four diﬀerent groups within the\\\\npopulation: those who are susceptible (S); those who are in-\\\\nfected (I); those who have recovered (R); and those who have\\\\ndied (D).\\\\nThe governing equations of my model are as follows:\\\\nS + I\\\\nβ\\\\n−→2I\\\\nI\\\\nγ\\\\n−→R\\\\nI\\\\nδ\\\\n−→D\\\\nWhere β is the contact rate, γ is the rate of recovery, and δ is\\\\nthe rate of death. From these equations, the following system\\\\nof ODEs can be found and solved [6]:\\\\ndS\\\\ndt = −β\\\\nNSI\\\\ndI\\\\ndt = β\\\\nNSI −(γ + δ)I\\\\ndR\\\\ndt = γI\\\\ndD\\\\ndt = δI\\\\nFitting the Model to the Data\\\\nI used least squares regression from python’s lmﬁt module to\\\\nﬁt my SIRD model to my data [7]. I began by assuming that\\\\nmy rates β, γ and δ were all constant. However, after plotting\\\\nthe results of this model, I quickly realised that my value of β\\\\nneeded to decrease with time. Therefore, I decided to deﬁne\\\\nβ(t) as a function instead. I found this function intuitively\\\\nusing a negative exponential model multiplied by the β value\\\\nfound. I also assumed that the initial number of susceptible in\\\\nItaly was equal to the population: 60,461,828 [1]. The results\\\\nfor recovery and death rates were as follows:\\\\nγ = 0.0234\\\\nδ = 0.0064\\\\nThe following values of β correspond to the start of the data\\\\nand the end of lockdown:\\\\n18/02/2020\\\\nβ = 0.1473\\\\n14/05/2020\\\\nβ = 0.0080\\\\nFrom these values of β we can see that at the end of lockdown,\\\\nthe infection rate was much lower, as expected, due to much\\\\nfewer contacts between those in the susceptible group and those\\\\nin the infected group.\\\\nR0\\\\nAn important feature of modelling epidemics is the basic repro-\\\\nduction number R0. This number is the number of secondary\\\\ninfections resulting from a single primary infection. The reason\\\\nthis value is so important is that it is an indication of whether\\\\nthe disease will die out (R0 < 1), or if it will become an en-\\\\ndemic (R0 > 1) [4]. This value changes when measures are\\\\nimplemented that reduce the rate of infection, like lockdown.\\\\nR0 can be found using the following equation [7]:\\\\nR0 = β(t)\\\\nγ\\\\nUsing my model, I have found values of R0 at diﬀerent times:\\\\n18/02/2020\\\\nR0 = 6.2929\\\\n22/04/2020\\\\nR0 = 1.0052\\\\n23/04/2020\\\\nR0 = 0.9542\\\\n14/05/2020\\\\nR0 = 0.3405\\\\nR0 is ﬁrst below 1, meaning that the disease has begun dying\\\\nout, on the 23rd April 2020, in the middle of the lockdown pe-\\\\nriod. This suggests that lockdown was eﬀective. When Italy\\\\nbegan relaxing its lockdown measures, R0 was very small, how-\\\\never as the lockdown eases and contact rates increase that value\\\\ncould easily rise once again.\\\\nAssumptions\\\\nSIRD modelling has many drawbacks. First of all, the assumes that once you have been infected you are then immune to the virus,\\\\nwhich has not been proved or disproved for coronavirus yet. If this assumption is proved wrong, the model would be unreliable\\\\nuntil another category is added in. My model assumes that you become infectious when you become infected (i.e. when you test\\\\npositive), however, according to Harvard Medical School [2], you actually become infectious up to 72 hours before you show any\\\\nsymptoms. Another assumption is that there are no births in the population. There are also problems with the accuracy and\\\\nreliability of the data [8] being used. Many cases of coronavirus go unreported and untested. There could also be a high proportion\\\\nof asymptomatic cases [3], which will also remain unrecorded.\\\\nThe Model\\\\nFigure 1:Data vs Model plotted between 18/02/2020 and 07/06/2020\\\\nForecast\\\\nFigure 2:Model plotted between 18/02/2020 and 06/08/2020\\\\nConclusion\\\\nAlthough I do not believe that the model I have gener-\\\\nated is very accurate, it seems that Italy is very much on\\\\nthe way towards eradicating coronavirus. However, the un-\\\\nknown proportion of the population that has coronavirus\\\\nand is asymptomatic, along with the unrecorded cases,\\\\ncould mean that we may begin to see an upward trend\\\\nin the number of cases. Potentially even a second peak.\\\\nGoing forward, I would like to add in more compartments\\\\ninto my model (such as the exposed compartment), in order\\\\nto increase the accuracy of the model. This exposed cate-\\\\ngory would remove the need for a dampener on the rate of\\\\ninfection, as a contact rate would then also be estimated,\\\\nmaking a much more reliable model. I would also like to\\\\ncompare various countries which have now left lockdown\\\\nin order to see how exiting the lockdown has aﬀected their\\\\ninfection rates and whether a second spike seems likely.\\\\nReferences\\\\n[1] “Our world in data coronavirus.” [Online].
