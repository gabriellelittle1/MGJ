This task is particularly challenging, as a\\nsuccessful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a\\ncohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes\\naccessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage\\nconsiderations. Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are\\ntypically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design\\ndesign considerations used in producing the final layout. In this paper, we\\ninvestigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for\\ninterior design. While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating\\ncomplete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner,\\ninspired by the workflow of interior designers. By systematically probing LLMs,\\nwe can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that\\nguide their placement. We translate this information into a design layout\\ngraph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization\\nsetup to generate the final layouts. We benchmark our algorithm in various\\ndesign configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and\\nevaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics\\nalong with user studies. In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a\\nstructured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts,\\nmaking them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.
