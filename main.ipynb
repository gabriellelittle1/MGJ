Introduction\\nInterior designing is the art of creating balanced, functional, and\\naesthetically pleasing spaces based on intended space usage and ad-\\njusted to individual preferences. The goal is to propose a selection\\nof objects, both in terms of the type and style of the objects along\\nwith their arrangement, that best serves the project brief provided\\nby the client. A good design not only considers the aesthetic look of\\nthe objects, but also factors in the flow of the designed space, tak-\\ning into consideration affordability of the objects along with their\\nfunctionality and access space.\\nThe design task is challenging, as one has to balance aesthetics,\\nfunctionality, and practicality within a given space while consid-\\n\\n--- Page 2 ---\\n2 of 45\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J. Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\nering the user’s needs, preferences, and budget. It is particularly\\ndifficult to identify, keep track, and balance a variety of conflict-\\ning constraints that arise from ergonomics and usage while harmo-\\nnizing furniture, lighting, and materials. Hence, users often take\\nshortcuts and fall back to a rule-based or preauthored solution that\\nbest fits their specifications. However, achieving a customized, co-\\nhesive, visually appealing and functional design requires creativity,\\ntechnical expertise, and remains difficult for most users.\\nTo gain inspiration, we first studied how interior designers ap-\\nproach the problem. Upon receiving project briefs, they divide the\\nspace into zones according to their intended function. They then\\nbegin by selecting and placing the focal objects for the key zones,\\nbefore arranging other objects around them. Throughout this pro-\\ncess, they carefully consider design aspects to ensure that objects\\nare easily accessible and usable and that the room has good flow to\\nfacilitate movement. Finally, they incorporate lighting and decide\\non the style of the objects, as well as the wall and floor style to\\ncreate a harmoniously designed space. The most non-trivial aspect\\nis the variety of spatial and functional considerations that designers\\nconsider and conform to while designing the space.\\nIn this paper, we ask if large language models (LLMs) can be repur-\\nposed for interior design. We hypothesize that LLMs that have been\\ntrained on various text corpora, including design books and blogs,\\nare likely to know about layout design concepts. We ask how ex-\\nplicit these concepts are and how good they are in quality. Directly\\nquerying LLMs to produce room layouts based on text guidance\\n(e.g., ‘Please design a drawing room of size 4m×5m for a teenager\\nwho loves music’) regularly produced mixed results that had good\\ndesign ideas but not usable in practice (see Figure 2). Although the\\noutput images of the room looked aesthetically pleasing, closer in-\\nspection revealed many design flaws. Unfortunately, when asked\\nfor output floorplans, LLMs produced rather basic layouts that did\\nnot meet expectations.\\nInterestingly, we found that LLMs have good knowledge of indi-\\nvidual design considerations, including non-local constraints. For\\nexample, when asked about ‘the most important design considera-\\ntion for a kitchen’ LLMs described the kitchen work triangle, which\\nis an important design consideration that many of us are unaware\\nof and can easily get wrong, severely affecting the functionality\\nof the space. Encouraged by this and inspired by interior design-\\ners’ workflow, we break the interior design task into stages. Instead\\nof directly using LLMs to get the final layout, we progressively\\nprobe the LLMs, in a structured fashion, to first zone the given\\nspace and then extract a list of objects to populate the different\\nzones. More importantly, we also elicit a list of intra-object and\\ninter-object constraints along with descriptive attributes for the se-\\nlected objects. Then, using a symbolic translation, we organize the\\nLLMs output into a layout constraint graph by converting the tex-\\ntual constraints to algebraic constraints in terms of the object vari-\\nables (i.e., their size and placement). We then obtain the layout by\\nsolving the resultant constrained system. Finally, we retrieve ob-\\njects to populate the designed layout using the object-specific types\\nand attributes obtained from the LLMs to produce the final layouts.\\nFigure 1 presents a selection of example outputs from our method,\\nFlairGPT: Functional Layouts for Aesthetic Interior Realisations.\\nWe evaluated our method in a variety of interior design settings.\\nWe compared ours with the latest interior design alternatives (e.g.,\\nATISS [PKS∗21], Holodeck [YSW∗23], LayoutGPT [FZF∗24])\\nand against user-designed layouts.

Users consistently preferred our generations over the\\nothers, including those done by novice users, and scored ours well\\nwith respect to adhering to design specifications as well as produc-\\ning functionally useful layouts. We also evaluate perform quanti-\\ntative evaluation on the generated layouts. In addition, we report\\nour findings on the aspects of the design process where LLMs offer\\nsignificant value and those that are best managed, at least for now,\\nby human expertise. Code will be released upon acceptance.\\n2. Related Works\\nOptimization-based layouts. Interior design relies on spatial ar-\\nrangement, human-centric aesthetics, and functional optimiza-\\ntion [Ale18]. Early computational approaches for generating sim-\\nple layouts [HWB95,MP02] concentrated on manually defining lo-\\ncal constraints and employing optimization techniques to solve for\\noptimal spatial arrangements. Later, inspired by established inte-\\nrior design guidelines, Merell et al. [MSL∗11] introduced an inter-\\nactive system that allowed users to define the shape of the room\\nand a selected set of furniture, after which the system generates\\ndesign layouts that adhere to specified design principles. Make it\\nhome [YYT∗11] employed hierarchical and spatial relationships\\nfor furniture objects with ergonomic priors in their cost function to\\nyield more realistic furniture arrangements. In a recent optimiza-\\ntion method, Weiss et al. [WLD∗19] use physics-based principles\\nto create room layouts by treating objects as particles within a phys-\\nical system. The method emphasizes both functionality and har-\\nmony in the room by applying specific constraints to ensure walk-\\n\\n--- Page 3 ---\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J. Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\n3 of 45\\nways, maintain balanced visual appeal around a focal point, etc.\\nHowever, it still requires users to manually specify constraints.\\nData-driven layouts. Rather than relying on hard coded rules for\\noptimization, modern data-driven methods aim to learn such con-\\ncepts automatically [RWL19, WSCR18, TNM∗23]. For example,\\nATISS [PKS∗21] treats indoor scene synthesis as an unordered set\\ngeneration problem, to allow flexibility by avoiding the constraints\\nof fixed object orderings. ATISS uses a transformer architecture to\\nencode floorplans and object attributes to sequentially place objects\\nbased on category, size, orientation, and location. While visually\\nappealing, ATISS suffers from practical limitations such as overlap-\\nping objects. To enhance practicality, LayoutEnhancer [LGWM22]\\nintegrates expert ergonomic knowledge—such as reachability, visi-\\nbility, and lighting—directly into the transformer model for indoor\\nlayout generation. However, the method falls short in considering\\nstylistic elements, limiting its ability to generate complex aestheti-\\ncally tailored designs. SceneHGN [GSM∗23] creates a hierarchical\\ngraph of the scene to capture relationships among objects to pro-\\nduce visually coherent 3D environments. Tell2Design [LZD∗23]\\nreformulates the task of generating floor plans as a sequential task\\nwhere the input is language instructions and the output is bounding\\nboxes of rooms. Although data-driven methods can produce good\\nresults, they are limited in diversity and creativity due to their re-\\nliance on curated datasets and are often restricted to special types\\nof rooms and/or objects.\\nLLM-based layouts. With advances in capabilities of Large Lan-\\nguage Models [Bro20,TAB∗23,TLI∗23,JSR∗24], LLMs are being\\nincreasingly used to solve a plethora of complex tasks such as rea-\\nsoning [MP24], programming [RGG∗23], discovering mathemati-\\ncal concepts [RPBN∗24], conducting scientific research [LLL∗24],\\netc. Building on this success, the integration of LLMs in scene syn-\\nthesis offers the ability to generate context-aware designs by inter-\\npreting and applying textual descriptions directly to the synthesis\\nprocess. This enables a more dynamic and flexible approach, allow-\\ning for the integration of complex design principles that are often\\ndifficult to encode through conventional algorithms.\\nHolodeck et al. [YSW∗23] utilize LLM to expand user text prompts\\nto generate a scene into actionable scene elements. However, the\\nactual placement and relationship of objects are governed by a\\nset of predefined spatial rules hard-coded into the system that can\\nlimit the flexibility and creativity of the system to adapt to uncon-\\nventional or complex designs. In a very recent system, Layout-\\nGPT [FZF∗24] uses LLMs to generate scene layouts by treating\\nelements within the scene as components that can be described and\\nadjusted programmatically akin to web elements in CSS. In an-\\nother notable effort, Aguina-Kang et al. [AKGH∗24] employ LLMs\\nto create more detailed scene specifications from simple prompts,\\nidentify necessary objects and finally generate programs in domain\\nspecific language to place those objects in the scene. After estab-\\nlishing one of ten relationships between objects from a library,\\nthe final placement is obtained using gradient descent based op-\\ntimization. LLplace [YLZ∗24] fine tunes Llama3 [TLI∗23] on an\\nexpanded 3D-Front Dataset [FCG∗20] to allow users a more inter-\\nactive way to add and remove objects in a conversational manner.\\nI-Design [CHS∗24] uses multiple LLMs to convert a text input into\\na scene graph and obtain a physical layout using a backtracking al-\\ngorithm. Strader et al. [SHC∗23] leverage LLMs to build “spatial\\nontology” (to store concepts), which is used in node classification\\nsystems of 3D scene graphs.\\nWhile LLMs have made it easier to automate the application of\\ninterior design principles, the complexity of spatial relationships\\nand functional constraints remain a significant hurdle and do not\\nyet capture the depth and realism of actual spaces. In contrast, our\\napproach draws heavily on traditional interior design practices to\\nguide layout generation, ensuring that each layout is both func-\\ntional and aesthetically balanced. By doing so, we aim to bridge the\\ngap between automated systems and the nuanced decision making\\nprocess that human designers bring to their work.\\n3. Design Considerations\\nIn this section, we briefly summarize the process followed by in-\\nterior designers as documented in design literature books [BS13,\\nMit12,Ale18].\\nThe process starts with a design brief where the clients describe\\nhow they plan to use the space, provide background on their prefer-\\nences, and detail the current layout of the space (e.g., walls, doors,\\nwindows). Budget and time frames are also discussed in this stage,\\nbut we ignore these in our setup.\\nSpace planning, the next phase, is the most challenging. This in-\\nvolves creating functional layouts and optimizing the use of space.\\nSpecifically, they determine the choice and arrangement of furni-\\nture while considering flow, accessibility, and ergonomics. Design-\\ners typically start by collecting measurements of the space and not-\\ning the features of the room such as doors, windows, and electrical\\noutlets. Next, they zone the space by partitioning the region into\\ndistinct areas based on its functions. For example, in an open-plan\\nlayout, designers allocate areas for dining, working, and socializing\\nwithout the need for physical barriers. In this stage, they also take\\ntraffic flow into account to create pathways or circulation areas that\\navoid overcrowding and allow a smooth transition between zones.\\nHaving zoned the space, designers then select and place key pieces\\nof furniture, usually referred to as primary objects, in strategic po-\\nsitions. Large items (e.g., sofas, tables, beds) are first positioned in\\norder to anchor the space. Designers use their experience to balance\\nfunctionality and aesthetics to create visual interest and harmony in\\nthe space. Next, they incorporate secondary objects (such as chairs,\\nappliances, etc.) around the primary objects to ensure the regions\\nare functional. At this point, artificial lighting is also added if nec-\\nessary. Besides selecting the types and sizes of objects, designers\\nalso consider their color and finish to create a cohesive look in the\\ndesigned space while maintaining its functionality.\\nFinally, during design development, designers collect client feed-\\nback based on previsualization of the space and iterate on the de-\\nsign to better align the space to their clients’ vision.\\n4. Algorithm\\nOur method consists of three key phases. In the first phase, the Lan-\\nguage Phase, we progressively query the LLM to make informed\\ndecisions about the room’s layout and design. The model identi-\\nfies all relevant objects for the space along with their dimensions\\n(width and length). More importantly, the LLM provides a set of\\nspatial constraints that governs the positioning and arrangement of\\nthese objects. In the second phase, the Translation Phase, we con-\\nvert the language-based constraints obtained from the LLM into ex-\\necutable function calls, drawing from a predefined library of con-\\n\\n--- Page 4 ---\\n4 of 45\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J. Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\nFigure 3: Method overview. FlairGPT begins by taking the user’s design request as a text prompt and querying an LLM to extract key room\\nparameters, such as dimensions and the location and number of windows, doors, and sockets. Next, following a designer’s workflow, the LLM\\ngenerates an ordered list of zones, specifying the functional purpose of different areas within the room. Based on these zones, a prioritized list\\nof required objects is generated, complete with descriptions and dimensions. These objects serve as the nodes of a layout graph, with inter-\\nand intra-object constraints—defined by the LLM—forming the edges. The natural language constraints provided by the LLM are translated\\ninto algebraic forms by querying the LLM to map these constraints to a predefined library of cost functions. Once these cost functions are\\nestablished, the placement and orientation of objects are progressively optimized according to their hierarchical importance. Finally, objects\\nare retrieved, based on their descriptions, and incorporated into the scene.\\nstraint cost functions thus forming a layout constraint graph. Fi-\\nnally, in the Optimization Phase, we use an optimization (SLSQP)\\nto find a minimal-cost solution that satisfies the combined set of\\nconstraints. We stagger this phase into multiple iterations with dif-\\nferent initial configurations. Upon completion, we obtain the full\\nspecification of all objects, including their style, dimensions, posi-\\ntions, and orientation. We now provide details on each phase.\\n4.1. The Language Phase\\nUser input. We expect the user to provide a textual description of\\nthe room they wish to generate. This input can range from simple\\nprompt, such as “a bedroom,” to more detailed specifications like,\\n“a 5 × 5m bedroom for a young girl who enjoys painting while\\nlooking out of her window.” This flexibility allows users to define\\na wide variety of room configurations.\\nA. Extracting room parameters. Once the user input has been\\nprovided, we query the LLM to establish the fundamental parame-\\nters of the room that serve as the fixed boundary condition for the\\nrest of the stages. The model generates the dimensions of the room\\n(width and length), with the height fixed at 3 meters by default.\\nThe LLM also prescribes how many windows, doors, and electrical\\nsockets the room requires, as well as their placements (which wall\\nthey should be on and their horizontal position along that wall). Ad-\\nditionally, the model provides the width of the windows and doors.\\nNote that we designed a fixed schema to convert user specifications\\nto queries for the LLM. Please see supplemental for details. Users\\ncan alternatively bypass this step if they prefer to directly input the\\nroom specifications.\\nB. Zoning the space. Next, similar to how human designers pro-\\nceed, we query the LLM to determine the core purposes of the\\nroom, which define its zones. The number and type of zones vary\\ndepending on the room’s size and intended use. The LLM outputs\\nan ordered list of zones, ranked by significance. For example, in a\\nbedroom, the zones can include {sleeping, storage, dress-\\ning} areas. We denote this ordered list by Z := {z1,...,zk}. Note\\nthat we do not partition the room into zones at this stage.\\nC. Deciding the room objects. Our next major design task is to\\ndecide which objects to include in the room along with their size\\nand textual description. Again, following designers’ workflow, we\\nproceed in stages.\\n(i) Listing the primary objects. We define a primary object as\\nthe most essential object required for each zone to fulfill its in-\\ntended purpose (these are often referred as focal objects). Again,\\nwe query the LLM to determine the primary objects, along with\\ntheir dimensions (see supplemental for query schema). The out-\\nput is an ordered list where each entry includes the primary ob-\\nject pi corresponding to zone zi, as well as the object’s width (wi)\\nand length (li). Thus, the list of primary objects takes the form\\nP := {(p1,w1,l1),...,(pk,wk,lk)}. So far, we have obtained the\\ntype, width, and length for each primary object, but not their height.\\n(ii) Listing the secondary objects. We then query the LLM to iden-\\ntify secondary objects, defined as additional items that enhance the\\nfunctionality of each zone, provided they are floor-based (excluding\\nrugs). The output is an ordered list of secondary objects S, where\\neach object si includes its width (wi), length (li) and the correspond-\\ning zone z(si) to which it belongs. Note that each zone can have\\nmultiple secondary objects. In addition, the output specifies how\\nmany of each object are needed. For example, four dining chairs\\nor two nightstands might be required in a given zone. Thus, we\\nhave, S := {(s1,w1,l1,z(s1)),...,(sns,wns,lns,z(sns))} with ns be-\\ning number of secondary objects.\\n(iii) Listing the tertiary objects. We then query the LLM to gener-\\nate the final set of objects, the tertiary ones. Such objects are ‘at-\\ntached’ to specific primary/secondary objects or room boundary.\\n\\n--- Page 5 ---\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J. Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\n5 of 45\\nExample of a Blank Constraint Cost Function for Inter-Object Constraints\\nExample of a Blank Constraint Cost Function for Individual Constraints\\nFigure 4: Doc string for library functions. An example of our doc-\\nstrings which contain usage examples and thorough descrip-\\ntions of each function’s purpose and its parameters. Note that the\\nunderlying implementation of the functions is absent. The LLM is\\ntasked to map each language-based constraint to a corresponding\\ncost function within the library during the language phase.\\nThese include ceiling-mounted objects (e.g., chandeliers), wall-\\nmounted objects (e.g., paintings), objects placed on surfaces (e.g.,\\ntable lamps), and rugs. While majority of the tertiary objects are\\ndecorative, functional items such as computers and lighting can\\nalso be suggested at this stage. We also query the LLM for de-\\ntailed placement instructions, specifying how and where these ob-\\njects should be positioned relative to other objects or zones within\\nthe room. For example, the LLM might suggest, “place a painting\\non the wall above the bed.”\\nThe output is an unordered list T of tertiary objects, each de-\\nscribed in relation to another object (either Primary or Secondary),\\na boundary wall, or simply a specific zone. For each tertiary ob-\\nject ti, we also obtain its type (typei), one of wall, floor, ceiling,\\nor surface, along with its width (wi), length (li), and a language-\\nbased placement constraint (ci). The final output is an unordered\\nlist T := {(t1,w1,l1,type1,c1),...,(tnt,wnt,lnt,typent,cnt)}, where\\ntypei specifies the object type, ci provides the placement instruc-\\ntions, and nt being the number of tertiary objects.\\nThe language constraints (ci) are treated separately from those of\\nprimary and secondary objects, as tertiary objects can be positioned\\nin ways that others cannot — such as on the ceiling, walls, atop\\nother objects, or underneath primary or secondary objects.\\n(iv) Determining style for the objects. Having listed all the objects,\\nwe move on to determine the style of the room and the individual\\nobjects using the given description for the room. We query the LLM\\nto specify the style of the room and each individual object. The\\nLLM provides textual details such as materials, colors, and patterns\\nfor the walls and floors. For instance, it might suggest “dove grey\\npaint with an accent wall featuring a subtle geometric wallpaper.”\\nEach object, including windows and doors, is further described by\\nthe LLM in terms of material, color, and overall aesthetic.\\nD. Listing of design constraints\\nSo far we have the specification of the room boundary and a tex-\\ntual list of the objects to be placed in the room. The list of objects\\nP ∪S ∪T forms the nodes of our layout graph. Next, we use the\\nLLM to list all the relevant inter- and intra-object constraints, which\\nbecome the (undirected) edges of our layout graph. We only con-\\nsider pairwise constraints in our setup.\\n(i) Intra-object constraints. These constraints refer to those that ap-\\nply to a single object, either a primary or secondary object, and any\\nfeatures of the room (including walls, windows, doors, and sock-\\nets). These constraints govern the positioning and usability of an\\nindividual object. For example, the LLM might specify, “the bed\\nshould have its headboard against the wall,” or “the bed should not\\nbe too close to a window to avoid drafts.” This category also in-\\ncludes accessibility requirements, such as determining which sides\\nof the object must remain accessible for it to function properly. At\\nthis stage, we query the LLM to generate all such constraints by\\nlooping over all the nodes in P ∪S and collect them for all the\\nprimary and secondary objects in natural language.\\n(ii) Inter-object constraints. These constraints involve relationships\\nbetween pairs of primary and secondary objects. For instance, the\\nLLM might suggest, “the mirror should not face the bed,” or “the\\nbed should be placed between the two nightstands.” When the con-\\nstraint applies only between primary objects, we encourage the\\nLLM to create simple spatial relationships such as “near to” or “far\\nfrom,” since these objects often belong to different zones.\\n(iii) Constraint cleaning. The final step in the Language Phase\\nserves as a self-correction tool. We query the LLM to review and\\nrefine the generated constraints. This involves merging any similar\\nconstraints, removing duplicates, and simplifying the constraints\\ninto more straightforward language to minimize errors during the\\nTranslation Phase. The LLM also identifies and eliminates any con-\\ntradictory constraints. Additionally, we use the LLM to split con-\\nstraints that contain multiple pieces of information. For example,\\n“the bed should not block windows or doors” would be split into\\n“the bed should not block windows” and “the bed should not block\\ndoors”. This is not applied to the tertiary constraints, due to there\\nonly being one constraint per tertiary object.\\n4.2. The Translation Phase\\nNext, we convert the language constraints into algebraic forms. For\\nthis phase, we created a “blank” version of our library of con-\\nstraint cost functions. This blank version contains the names of\\nthe functions, along with detailed docstrings for each func-\\ntion. These docstrings include usage examples and thorough\\ndescriptions of each function’s purpose and its parameters. Note\\nthat these strings only provide function names and lists of variables\\nto the LLMs, but not the underlying implementation of the func-\\ntions. Figure 4 shows an example; more details are provided in the\\nsupplemental.\\nThe purpose of these blank functions is to utilize the natural lan-\\nguage processing capabilities of the LLM to map each language-\\nbased constraint to a corresponding cost function within the library.\\nThis process is carried out in three distinct stages: one for Individ-\\nual or Intra-Object constraints, one for for Inter-Object constraints,\\nand one for tertiary constraints. By processing these constraints\\nseparately, we ensure the correct type of function is applied, reduc-\\ning the risk of using the wrong function for a particular constraint.\\n\\n--- Page 6 ---\\n6 of 45\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J. Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\nFigure 5: Generated layouts by FlairGPT. We present varied layouts designed by FlairGPT for three distinct prompts (from left to right)- “4m\\nx 5m bedroom”, “small workroom for a wizard”, and “bedroom for a vampire”. Alongside each layout, we include descriptions of selected\\nobjects provided by the LLM, which closely align with the user’s design brief. Notably, FlairGPT makes creative and context-appropriate\\nobject choices, such as a scroll holder and a crystal ball for a wizard’s workroom, and a coffin in place of a traditional bed in the case of a\\nvampire’s bedroom, reflecting the thematic style of the input prompts.\\nIf no suitable matching function can be found for a given constraint,\\nwe discard the corresponding language constraint. Additionally, if\\nthe parameters provided to the function do not match the expected\\ninputs, we ensure the function safely returns a cost value of 0, re-\\nducing errors in the subsequent optimization process.\\nExample of language constraints being translated into\\ncode\\n### 1.

The Optimization Phase\\nFinally, we are ready to place the objects by determining the co-\\nordinates (x,y) of the centroid and the orientation (θ) of each ob-\\nject. Given the highly constrained nature of the problem, we split\\nthe optimization process into several steps, progressively solving\\nfor the layout. For each step, we compute a combined cost using\\nall relevant constraint cost functions, as provided by our library\\nfunctions, and find the optimal solution using a Sequential Least\\nSquares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) solver. To improve ro-\\nbustness, we repeat each optimization with different initializations\\nfor the variables, and take the best solution. For each object i, we\\noptimize its position (xi,yi) and orientation θi. Note that we define\\norientation with respect to forward-facing direction of each object.\\nIn addition to the combined cost function that is derived from all\\nlanguage constraints Clang, as defined above, we include five addi-\\ntional cost functions for the first two stages of the optimization (i.e.,\\nprimary and secondary object placement). They are,\\n(i) A no-overlap cost Cover which penalizes intersections be-\\ntween objects. In Equation 1, we show the formulation where,\\nfor every pair of objects i and j, we find the projected 2D\\npolygon formed by their intersection (polyi j). We then apply\\na function f, which sums the squared lengths of the sides of\\nthis polygon. This calculation is also applied to every object\\ni in relation to any doors d, ensuring that no object intersects\\nwith a door, and for this term we add a scaling factor λ1 (we\\nuse 100 in our experiments). In particular, the cost term is as\\nfollows,\\nCover := ∑\\ni\\n[∑\\nj\\>i\\nf(polyi j)+λ1∑\\nd\\nf(polyid)].\\n(1)\\n(ii) An in-bounds cost Cbound which penalizes objects that extend\\nbeyond the room’s boundaries. In Equation 2, we show the\\nformulation for object i, where we iterates over its corners\\nci j; Icij is an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 if the\\ncorner ci j lies within the room boundary, B, otherwise it is 0.\\nCbound,i :=\\n3\\n∑\\nj=0\\n(1−Icij) dist(ci j,B)2.\\n(2)\\n(iii) An alignment cost Calign which weakly penalizes orientations\\nthat deviate from the cardinal directions. Namely, we use\\nCalign,i := sin2(2θi)\\n5\\n.\\n(3)\\n(iv) A balanced placement cost Cbal that penalizes deviations of\\n\\n--- Page 7 ---\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J. Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\n7 of 45\\nthe weighted centroid of all of the objects from the center of\\nthe room. The formulation of this is shown in Equation 4,\\nwhere w and l are the width and length of the room, and for\\nobject i, ai is the area of the bounding box.\\nCbal :=\\n\\u0012\\n∑i aixi\\n∑i ai\\n−w\\n2\\n\\u00132\\n+\\n\\u0012\\n∑i aiyi\\n∑i ai\\n−l\\n2\\n\\u00132\\n.\\n(4)\\n(v) A wall-attraction cost Cwall which weakly encourages objects\\nto be near the walls. This is to prevent ‘floating’ objects from\\nbeing placed centrally in the room. The formulation is shown\\nin Equation 5, where if the distance of object i, oi, from the\\nclosest wall is greater than a given threshold T, a penalty is\\napplied. We find that scaling this cost with a factor (λ2) works\\nbetter. We use λ2 = 20 in all of our experiments.\\nCwall,i := 1\\nλ2\\n\\u0012\\nmin(T −min\\nω∈wallsdist(oi,ω),0.0)2\\n\\u0013\\n.\\n(5)\\nThese functions account for all objects that are present in the room\\nat the time of optimization. For instance, during the first optimiza-\\ntion step, only overlaps between the primary objects are consid-\\nered. Subsequently, intersections involving the newly added sec-\\nondary objects are evaluated, along with any intersections between\\nthe secondary and previously placed primary objects.\\nA. Primary object placement. We begin by optimizing the lo-\\ncations and orientations of the primary objects (i ∈P). These lo-\\ncations and orientations are influenced by room features such as\\nwalls, windows, doors, and sockets, as well as by the positioning\\nof other primary objects. We solve the following SLSQP, where\\nλi,i ∈1,2,3 are tunable parameters. We use λ3 = 5,λ4 = 10 and\\nλ5 = 10 in all of our experiments.\\nmin\\n{xi,yi,θi}P\\nCpri := λ3Cover +λ4Cbal + ∑\\ni∈P\\n(Clang,i+\\nλ5Cbound,i +Calign,i +Cwall,i)\\n(6)\\nOnce the positions and orientations are determined, we initialize\\nthe zones, setting each initial centroid as the position of the cor-\\nresponding primary object’s. We then use Voronoi segmentation\\nbased on these centroids to define the corresponding zones (zi).\\nAfter optimizing the primary objects, we record the name, width,\\nlength, style description, coordinates of its centroid, and orientation\\n(pi,wi,li,stylei,xi,yi,θi) of each object. These values are held fixed\\nduring subsequent optimizations.\\nB. Secondary object placement. At this stage, the initial zones\\nhave been defined, and the positions and orientations of the pri-\\nmary objects are fixed. We then proceed zone by zone, to add the\\nsecondary objects (i ∈S). The positioning and orientation of these\\nsecondary objects are influenced by room features (such as walls,\\nwindows, doors, and sockets), the primary objects, and other sec-\\nondary objects. We carry forward any accessibility constraints from\\nthe first stage, in order to ensure that the primary objects remain ac-\\ncessible. We add a default constraint Czone with a scaling factor λ6\\n(we use λ6 = 10 in all our experiments) to ensure that objects are\\nencouraged to stay within the correct zones,\\nCzone,i :=\\nk\\n∑\\nj̸=i\\nmin(dist(si,z j)−dist(si,zi),0.0)2.\\n(7)\\nThe overall optimization takes the form,\\nmin\\n{xi,yi,θi}Zk\\nCsec,k := λ3Cover + ∑\\ni∈Zk\\n(Clang,i +λ5Cbound,i+\\nCalign,i +Cwall,i +λ6Czone,i).\\n(8)\\nNote, compared to Equation 6 we add a constraint for zoning here\\nand remove Cbal. Once the secondary objects are fixed for a zone,\\nwe update the zone centroids by calculating the mean coordinates\\nof all objects (primary and secondary) within that zone. We then\\nredefine the zone boundaries using a new Voronoi segmentation\\nbased on the updated centroids.\\nAfter the secondary objects have been placed in all zones, we pro-\\nceed to incorporate the tertiary objects.\\nC. Tertiary object placement. For this step, we use an altered set\\nof default constraints that ensures that objects of the same type can-\\nnot overlap, and that tertiary objects that should be wall-mounted\\nare both on the wall (ω) and that they are avoiding intersections\\nwith doors and windows.\\nIn the final stage of optimization, we find the location and orien-\\ntation (xi,yi,θi) of all of the tertiary objects (i ∈T ) at once, re-\\ngardless of zone. We do these all at once since each object has only\\none constraint making the optimization simpler. In Equation 9 and\\nEquation 10, Cover[i, j] is the cost only between objects i and j, λ7\\nand λ8 are tunable parameters (we use 500 for both in our exper-\\niments), Itypei=type j is an indicator variable that has value 1 if ob-\\njects i and j have the same type, otherwise 0, and Iω is an indicator\\nvariable that has value 1 if the object is wall-mounted, otherwise 0.\\nThe optimization takes the form,\\nmin\\n{xi,yi,θi}ter\\nCter := ∑\\ni∈ter\\n[Clang,i +λ7Cbound,i +Calign,i +IωCon_wall,i\\n+\\n∑\\nj∈ter,j\\>i\\n(Itypei=typej)Cover[i,j]].\\n(9)\\nwith the wall alignment cost being defined as,\\nCon_wall,i :=\\n∑\\nj∈doors∪windows\\nλ8Cover[i,j]+ ∏\\nω∈walls\\n\\u0010\\ndist(ti,ω)+(θi −θω)2\\u0011\\n.\\n(10)\\n4.4. Object Retrieval and Visualization\\nHaving generated the final layout, we retrieve the objects based\\non their generated descriptions and add them to the scene for vi-\\nsualization. For each object (including windows and doors), we\\nsearch, using text, for an asset that matches the style description\\ngenerated, as described before. We scale the retrieved objects based\\non target width/depth, while proportionally scaling the height. We\\norient the objects based on the target angle θi assuming the ob-\\njects have consistent (front) orientation. We source these assets us-\\ning BlenderKit [?], and apply the same process for the wall and\\nfloor materials. In isolated cases, we manually modify the mate-\\nrials of the assets to better align with the descriptions produced\\nby the LLM. (The only other manual adjustments made in this\\nphase are for adding lighting for rendering.) We note that this\\n\\n--- Page 8 ---\\n8 of 45\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J. Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\nphase can be better automated using CLIP [RKH∗21] for object\\nretrieval, leveraging text-image similarity scores to fetch objects\\nfrom Objaverse [DSS∗23], as employed in competing methods like\\nHolodeck [YSW∗23]. Also, linking to a generative 3D modeling\\nsystem will reduce the reliance on the models in the database – this\\nis left for future exploration.\\n5. Evaluation\\nWe compare our approach with two recent LLM-based methods,\\nnamely LayoutGPT [FZF∗24] and HoloDeck [YSW∗23], and with\\ntransformer-based layout generator ATISS [PKS∗21]. We quanti-\\ntatively evaluate the layouts on practical measures such as acces-\\nsibility (pathway), area of overlapping objects, and area occupied\\nby objects that are out of bounds. We also conduct a user study to\\nqualitatively compare the quality of layouts and see how ours per-\\nforms compared to layouts created by amateurs. We also conduct\\nan ablation study to prove the effectiveness of our design choices.\\n5.1. Metrics\\n(i) Pathway cost: We design a cost function to evaluate the\\nclearance of pathways in a room to measure accessibil-\\nity/walkability. The pathway is generated using the medial\\naxis of the room boundary and the floor objects (primary and\\nsecondary objects) and is then expanded to a width of 0.6m.\\nThis pathway is represented as a set of points (P), and for\\neach primary or secondary object, we check if any of these\\npathway points lie within their bounding box Bi. If a point\\nis inside the bounding box, we compute the squared distance\\nfrom the pathway point to the nearest object boundary (∂Bi),\\nas\\nCpathway :=\\n∑\\ni∈{pri,sec} ∑\\np∈P∩Bi\\n[d (p,∂Bi)]2 .\\n(11)\\n(ii) Object overlap rate (OOR): In a good design layout, there\\nshould be no overlap between objects. We calculate the rate\\nof overlapped objects as follows:\\nOOR := ∑i ∑j\\>i Aover[i,j] +∑q ∑r\\>q Aover[q,r](Itypeq=typer)\\nw·l\\n(12)\\nwhere Aover[i, j] is the area of overlap between objects i and\\nj (including intersections with door buffers that account for\\nthe door swing area), Itypeq=typer is an indicator variable that\\nhas value 1 if tertiary objects q and r have the same type,\\notherwise 0; w and l are the width and the length of the room\\nrespectively.\\n(iii) Out of Bounds Rate (OOB): All objects must fit fully inside\\na room for practicality. We measure the rate of area occupied\\nby objects, which is out of bounds as follows:\\nOOB := ∑i Abound[i]\\nw·l\\n(13)\\nwhere Abound[i] is the area out of bounds for object i.\\n5.2. Quantitative Evaluation\\nWe\\ncompare\\nour\\nFlairGPT\\nwith\\nboth\\nclosed-universe\\nand\\nopen-universe\\nLLM-based\\nlayout\\ngeneration\\nmeth-\\nods—LayoutGPT\\n[FZF∗24]\\nand\\nHolodeck\\n[YSW∗23],\\nre-\\nspectively. The comparison is based on the three metrics outlined\\nin subsection 5.1, with results presented in Figure 10. FlairGPT\\nsignificantly outperforms both baseline methods across all metrics.\\nLayoutGPT, as a closed-universe approach, is constrained to\\ngenerating standard layouts for bedrooms and living rooms,\\nlacking the flexibility to create more stylized or unique designs.\\nPlease note that our method does not explicitly add cost functions\\nfor pathway (CPathway) but we ensure walkability as a result of\\nour wall-attraction cost, which encourages suitable objects to be\\nnear the wall as well as our customizable accessibility constraints\\nmapped by the LLM during the language phase.\\n5.3. Qualitative Evaluation\\nWe present the results of our method in Figure 6, showcasing lay-\\nouts generated from a variety of prompts. These range from tradi-\\ntional bedroom and living room designs to more specialized spaces,\\nsuch as a sewing room, and stylized concepts like “A small work-\\nroom for a wizard.” FlairGPT also demonstrates its ability to meet\\nspecific client-driven functional and aesthetic requirements, such as\\n“A bedroom that is 5x5 for a young girl who likes to paint whilst\\nlooking out of her window” or “An office for a bestselling writer in\\nNew York who likes to write Fantasy books”.\\nWe\\ncompare\\nour\\nmethod\\nagainst\\nbaseline\\nap-\\nproaches—LayoutGPT [FZF∗24] and Holodeck [YSW∗23]—in\\nFigure 9. Our results demonstrate a closer alignment with the\\ninput prompt for stylized designs. For instance, in the prompt\\n“A bedroom for a vampire,” the generated layout replaces the\\ntraditional bed with a coffin, showcasing FlairGPT’s creative and\\ncontext-aware object selection to match the thematic style of user\\nprompts. Video results are available on the supplemental webpage.\\nAdditionally, FlairGPT can generate multiple distinct layouts for\\nthe same input prompt, as seen in Figure 8, offering versatility and\\na range of design options that cater to individual preferences and\\nspecific requirements.\\nUser Study I. In this study, we asked users to compare FlairGPT\\nagainst three methods: the first two approaches are computational\\n(LayoutGPT [FZF∗24] and ATISS [PKS∗21]), the third one being\\nnovice human designers. We were unable to run ATISS directly as\\nthe model weights are not publicly available, so we used the results\\nreported in their paper instead.\\nTo compare our method against novice human designers, we re-\\ncruited 5 participants to design 2 layouts each. Each participant was\\nprovided with two blank floorplans containing windows and doors\\npositioned identically to those in our method (see supplemental for\\ndetails). They had 15 minutes per floorplan to draw bounding boxes\\nfor each object in the room (along with forward direction), without\\nguidance on object sizing. From these designs, we selected 4 lay-\\nouts (2 for each prompt) and reconstructed them in Blender using\\nthe same objects as our method. If a participant included objects\\nthat were not present in our room inventory, we selected assets that\\nmatched the specified style.\\nFor the computational methods, we study three different prompts,\\nfor the human method, two:\\n• Computational:\\n(i) “A bedroom that is 3m x 4m.”\\n(ii) “A bedroom that is 3.225 x 4.5m.”\\n(iii) “A living room that is 8m x 4m.”\\n\\n--- Page 9 ---\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J.

In an unlimited-time, two-\\nalternative forced choice task, they were asked to choose the “bet-\\nter layout” based on aesthetics, functionality, and adherence to the\\nprompt. A total of 21 participants participated in this experiment,\\nwith the outcomes presented in Table 2.\\nWe see that subjects prefer our results on average across prompts\\nin 88.9% of the cases over LayoutGPT, in 79.4% of the cases over\\nATISS, and in 63.2% of the cases over a human result (significant,\\np \\< 10−6, binomial test). Similar conclusions can be drawn when\\nlooking at individual prompt conditions (significant, p \\< 0.01, bi-\\nnomial test).\\nUser Study II. Study 2 uses the same methods and similar view-\\ning conditions as study 1, using the same prompts for the human\\nbaseline, but 5 prompts for our method:\\nP1. “A bedroom that is 4m x 5m.”\\nP2. “An office for a bestselling writer in New York who likes to\\nwrite Fantasy books.”\\nP3. “A sewing room.”\\nP4. “A small green boho dining room.”\\nP5. “A bedroom for a vampire.”\\nParticipants were shown a single result of a single method (as can\\nbe seen in Figure 7 (b)) and asked to rate with unlimited time on\\na five-point Likert scale according to five criteria: “object type”,\\n“object size”, “object style”, “object functionality”, and “overall\\nplacement”. We compare the four layouts drawn by novice human\\ndesigners against the same four prompts picked from our gener-\\nated results. A total of 17 participants participated in this experi-\\nment, where FlairGPT performed well across all criteria, as shown\\nin Figure 10. For the direct comparison between our layouts and\\nthe human-designed ones, we excluded the style criterion since the\\nrooms were constructed using the style produced by our method.\\nParticipants rated our method, aggregated across four criteria and\\nall rooms, at 4.19 compared to 3.82 for human designs (difference\\nsignificant at p \\< 0.0001, t-test).\\nLLM-based assessment. In our research, we aimed to test the\\nability of LLMs to evaluate the quality of a layout. Specifically,\\nwe sought to determine whether an LLM could classify a layout as\\n“good” or “bad” and identify potential flaws in the design. To ex-\\nplore this, we conducted an experiment with 24 bedroom layouts,\\nsome intentionally flawed and others well-designed. Four human\\nparticipants labeled each layout as either “good” or “bad” and pro-\\nvided reasoning for their classifications.\\n\\n--- Page 11 ---\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J. Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\n11 of 45\\nFigure 8: Diversity in Generated Layouts. FlairGPT demon-\\nstrates impressive versatility in scene generation for the same in-\\nput prompt-“A 5m x 3m home office”, producing a wide range of\\nlayouts driven by variations in the selection of objects and style\\n(guided by the LLM), and placement of windows, doors, and sock-\\nets. These elements significantly influence the arrangement of ob-\\njects during our optimization phase, resulting in diverse and dy-\\nnamic room configurations. We show primary and secondary ob-\\njects on the left and on the right we show tertiary objects.\\nWe extended this evaluation to both GPT-4o and SigLIP\\n[ZMKB23] using the same set of layouts. For this, we created four\\nrepresentations of each bedroom: a bounding box representation,\\na top-down 2D view, a top-down 3D view, and a perspective view\\nfrom an angle chosen (for best visibility) within the 3D room. Each\\nrepresentation was individually presented to GPT-4o, which was\\ntasked with listing the pros and cons of the layout before classify-\\ning it as either good or bad.\\nFor SigLIP, we employed the same bedroom representations, pair-\\ning each with three captions: a positive caption (“a good layout\\nfor a bedroom”), a neutral caption (“a layout for a bedroom”), and\\na negative caption (“a bad layout for a bedroom”). We calculated\\nsimilarity scores between the captions, denoted as Gi for good, Ni\\nfor neutral, and Bi for bad, and the images. A layout was classified\\nas good if 2Gi −Ni −Bi \\> 0.\\nFigure 9: Room layout comparison against baselines.

Specifically,\\nwe compare our method without the boundary cost (Cbound), with-\\nout the overlap cost (Cover), without the constraint cleaning phase,\\nand with all objects optimized simultaneously rather than following\\nour proposed hierarchical structure (for this, we allowed the opti-\\nmization to run for 1.5 hours before taking the best result; for com-\\nparison, ours takes 10-15 minutes on average). We evaluate these\\nvariants using the same out of bounds (OOB) and object overlap\\nrate (OOR) as described earlier. We also measure translation errors\\n(TE) which is described as\\nnumber of translation errors\\nnumber of uncleaned constraints.\\nTable 3: Ablation.

Conclusion\\nWe have presented FlairGPT as an LLM-guided interior designer.\\nWe demonstrated that LLMs offer a rich source of information that\\ncan be harnessed to help decide which objects to include for a tar-\\nget room along with their various intra- and inter-object constraints.\\nWe described how to convert these language constraints into al-\\ngebraic functions using a library of pre-authored cost functions.\\nHaving translated the functions, we solve and extract final room\\nlayouts, and retrieve objects based on the LLM-based object at-\\ntributes. Our evaluations demonstrate that human users favorably\\nrate our designed layouts. The generated layouts are explainable by\\nconstruction, as users can browse through the constraints used in\\nthe design process and optionally adjust their relative priority.\\nLimitations. Our study has several limitations that future work\\ncould address. First, FlairGPT designs are currently limited to rect-\\nangular rooms. Exploring application to irregularly shaped rooms,\\npossibly by approximating them with union of (axis-aligned) rect-\\nangles, would be an interesting direction. However, one has to come\\nup with a canonical naming convention for the walls to interact with\\nthe LLM to extract room-specific constraints.\\nSecond, we pre-authored a set of cost functions for translating the\\nLLM-specified constraints. In future work, we would like to inves-\\ntigate LLMs’ generative capabilities to propose new cost functions\\nfor the library. Currently, we find that the algebraic reasoning skills\\nof LLMs are inconsistent, making it challenging to develop an au-\\ntomated library generation capability. It is worth noting that our\\napproach was zero-shot, as we did not fine-tune the LLM with ex-\\nample library functions.\\nThird, the object attributes do not have height associated with them,\\nmaking it challenging to enforce constraints that prevent wall-\\nmounted items from being placed behind taller objects — for ex-\\nample, a painting behind a wardrobe.\\nFinally, as described, we leave it to the LLM to decide and handle\\nconflicting constraints in the constraint cleanup stage. Also, we fix\\nthe object size early in the pipeline when the LLM lists the room\\nobjects – this restricts possible adjustments in the subsequent opti-\\nmization phase. In the future, when LLMs can quantitatively eval-\\nuate layouts, or their descriptions, then one can imagine an outer\\nloop to backpropagate errors to update the list of selected objects\\nand/or their relevant constraints, and decide which objects or con-\\nstraints to drop.\\nAcknowledgments.

It includes incorrect\\nobject sizing, nonsensical constraints (e.g., “put the table lamp on the armchair”), or other errors in the initial LLM output.\\n• Cleaning Error: These errors occur during the cleaning phase. Examples include the unintended removal of constraints or the omission of\\ncrucial information from a constraint.\\n• Translation Error: This is the broadest category of errors and can occur at any point during the translation phase. It may involve matching\\na language constraint to a similar but suboptimal constraint (e.g., selecting “away from window” instead of “not blocking a window”),\\ncompletely misinterpreting the constraint, missing applicable constraints that have matching functions, or using incorrect parameters.\\nTranslation errors are the most frequent type of error.\\n• Contradictory Constraint Error: This error occurs when two or more constraints are chosen that are mutually exclusive, making it impos-\\nsible to satisfy all of them simultaneously within the solution.\\n• Optimization Error: An optimization error arises when an object is placed in a position that does not align with its constraints, and yet the\\noptimization process fails to find a better solution throughout the optimization process.\\nWhile there are many places for errors to arise, they are not all critical. For example, the most common translation error that we have seen\\nis choosing “ind_away_from” instead of “ind_not_block” which are similar constraints and will achieve the object not blocking the window.\\nWhen incorrect types of parameters are used, the function returns 0 so that constraint is lost. This can occur when choosing the sides of an\\nobject (one of “left”, “right”, “front” or “back”) with the LLM choosing something like “longer side”. The most problematic errors are the\\ncontradictory constraint errors and the optimization errors. These are the most visible in the outputs, however these are also far less frequent\\nthan translation errors.\\n\\n--- Page 16 ---\\n16 of 45\\nGabrille Littlefair, Niladri Shekhar Dutt, Niloy J.

Mitra / FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs\\n12. Full example for “A bedroom that is 4m x 5m.”\\nInput: “A bedroom that is 4m x 5m.”  \\nExtracting Parameters \\nPrompt 1:  I am designing the layout for a bedroom that is 4m x 5m.  Give me the \\ndimensions of the room, as well as the number of windows, doors, and sockets. For each of \\nthese, tell me the dimensions in meters, which wall it should be on, as well as where on the \\nwall it should be (a value between 0 and 1 determining how far along the wall it should be). \\nHere is an example for a room and window set up:  \\n{Room: width = 5, length = 6}, {Object type: window, width = 1, length = 0.1, wall = south, \\nposition = 3}. The windows and doors should all have length 0.1. Ensure that every object \\nhas dimensions, position, and wall. No other text please. Just the list with no commentary or \\nexplanation. \\nPrompt 2: The functions in the following file are used to create a room and out objects in it: \\n+ file_contents1. The room is described as “a bedroom that is 4m x 5m”. For every element \\nin this list, fixed_objects, translate it into a function call using the file attached. \\nFor example, given the room descriptor 'a small kitchen' as well as the list: {Room: width = \\n5, length = 6}, {Object type: window, Number: 1, width = 1, length = 0.1, wall = south, \\nposition = 0.3}, the output would be: \\nkitchen = create_room(5, 6), create_fixed_object(kitchen, 'window', 1, 0.1, 'south', position = \\n0.3). Return only the python script.  \\nNo other text. Please ensure the correct number of inputs are given for each function. \\nOutput 1:  \\nroom = create_room(4, 5) \\ncreate_fixed_object(room, 'door', 0.9, 0.1, 'west', 0.1) \\ncreate_fixed_object(room, 'window', 1.2, 0.1, 'south', 0.4) \\ncreate_fixed_object(room, 'window', 1.2, 0.1, 'east', 0.6) \\ncreate_fixed_object(room, 'socket', 0.2, 0.1, 'north', 0.3) \\ncreate_fixed_object(room, 'socket', 0.2, 0.1, 'west', 0.5) \\ncreate_fixed_object(room, 'socket', 0.2, 0.1, 'east', 0.2) \\n \\n \\nRegions  \\nPrompt1: I am designing the layout of a “a bedroom that is 4m x 5m”,  that is 4m x 5m. \\nInterior designers suggest that a good layout will have different regions in the room for \\ndifferent functions. What regions should I use, and how many regions (minimum is 1 region - \\nsmall rooms, e.g. 3x3, 2x3, etc, should only have 1 region, small medium sized rooms will \\nhave 2, 3x4, 4x3, 4x4, medium will have 3, etc) should there be based on the description, as\\n\\n--- Page 31 ---\\nwell as the size of the room. Make sure to not add too many regions as this causes \\novercrowding (very few rooms will have more than 4 regions). Return this as a simple bullet \\nlist of regions to include. Return these in list of priority order. Do NOT add too many regions. \\nOnly return the list of regions. No other information please. \\n \\nOutput: ['sleeping', 'storage', 'work'] \\n \\nPrompt 2: Given the room name: room_name , and the regions: regions, using the function \\nregion_setup defined below, initialise each region. For example 'eating region' might output \\n'region_setup(kitchen, 'eating', 0). Where possible the region name ('eating') should be  \\nonly one word. No other text please, only the python script. Don't include the function in the \\noutput. The function is:  \\ndef region_setup(room_name, name, index): \\n    '''A function that initialises the regions in a room randomly. \\n        Inputs: \\n        room_name: Room obj (this should be the name of the room) \\n        name: str, the name of the region e.g 'sleeping'index: int, the index of the region (0, 1, 2, \\n...).

Now for each one of the \\nregions: regions, what is the most important object to include (keep in mind the room \\ndescription), and what are its dimensions (give width of back of object and length of side of \\nobject but not height) in meters. ONLY one object per region. Don't include any objects that \\ngo on the walls, e.g. wall art, and don't include any rugs/mats. The size of the room is 4m x \\n5m, bear this in mind when choosing the objects and the size of the objects (i.e. put small \\nobjects in small rooms). Give no other information please. \\n \\nOutput:  \\n- Sleeping: Bed, 1.5m x 2m \\n- Storage: Wardrobe, 1.2m x 0.6m \\n- Work: Desk, 1.2m x 0.6m \\n \\nPrompt 2: Given a room described as: \\\"a bedroom that is 4m x 5m\\\", with size: 4m x 5m with \\nthese regions within it: regions, and these primary objects already in it: primary_objects, what \\nother objects should be added in?  \\nGive me 0-4 objects per region (depending on the size of the room - fewer objects for smaller \\nrooms, and more objects for larger room) that should be added into the room (so make sure \\nthey are the most appropriate/necessary objects for their regions). Ensure to add objects that \\nare necessary,e.g. if there's a desk, always add a desk chair. Try not to give objects that are \\nredundant, e.g. if there is a tv stand in the room, you don't need a media console. Objects \\nshould be things like furniture or plants or other objects that sit on the floor.For each one,\\n\\n--- Page 32 ---\\nmake sure that they make sense to go into one of the regions, and tell me which region they \\nshould go into. There can be more than one of each object kind (eg. multiple dining chairs or \\nmultiple nightstands) so make sure to specify how many of each object. Make sure to also \\ngive the dimensions of every object in meters (width of the back of the object and length of \\nthe side of the object but NOT HEIGHT). Remove any objects that are not placed directly on \\nthe floor, e.g. table lamp, and remove any objects that are mounted on the wall (e.g. \\npaintings). Don't include rugs. Only give objects that get placed onto the floor. Give no other \\ntext in the response. Only the list of objects. \\n \\nOutput:  \\n- Sleeping:  \\n  - Nightstand, 0.5m x 0.4m (2 items) \\n \\n- Storage:  \\n  - Dresser, 1.0m x 0.5m \\n \\n- Work:  \\n  - Desk Chair, 0.6m x 0.6m \\n \\nPrimary Objects, Secondary Objects Constraints  \\n \\nPrompt1: For each of these objects: primary_objects, tell me all of the considerations and \\nconstraints for its placement within the room described as “a bedroom that is 4m x 5m”, with \\nsize: 4m x 5m that depend only on fixed features in the room like walls, windows, doors, \\nsockets, etc. and return these as a bullet list for each object. Include practical things like \\nwhether it should be against a wall, or which side should be accessible for use (most objects \\nwill need an accessible constraint e.g. front of wardrobe needs to be accessible - however \\nvery few objects need all of their sides to be accessible and very few need their back to be \\naccessible.) or if its tall, maybe it shouldn't block a window, etc. Bear in mind the size of the \\nroom, for example if the room is large, then the front, left, and right of the bed should be \\naccessible, but if the room is very small, maybe only one side of the bed needs to be \\naccessible. Only give these constraints and considerations, no other information. \\n \\nOutput:  \\n### Bed (1.5m x 2m) \\n- Should be placed against a wall to maximize space. \\n- Should not block access to windows. \\n- Should not block access to doors. \\n- Front side should be accessible. \\n- Should allow for at least 60 cm of free space on one side for ease of getting in and out. \\n- Avoid placing under low-hanging fixtures if the ceiling is not uniformly high. \\n \\n### Wardrobe (1.2m x 0.6m) \\n- Should be placed against a wall for stability. \\n- Should not block access to windows. \\n- Should not block access to doors. \\n- Front side should be accessible for opening doors/drawers. \\n- Avoid placing it where it will block electrical sockets, unless not in use.\\n\\n--- Page 33 ---\\n- Ideally placed in a corner to save space. \\n \\n### Desk (1.2m x 0.6m) \\n- Should be placed against a wall to maximize space. \\n- Should not block access to windows to ensure sufficient natural light. \\n- Should not block access to doors. \\n- Front side should be accessible for seating and working. \\n- Ideally positioned near electrical sockets for easy access to power supply. \\n- Should not block airflow from vents or radiators if present. \\nPrompt 2: Tell me all of the constraints and considerations between the objects in this list, \\nprimary_objects, that depend only on each other. These objects are for different regions, so \\nthe constraints should only really be about them being away from each other or near each \\nother, nothing more specific. For example, maybe a desk should not be close to a bed, etc. \\nThe room is described as \\\"a bedroom that is 4m x 5m\\\", with size 4m x 5m. Only give the \\nconstraints and considerations between objects, no other information. \\nOutput:  \\n1. The bed should not be close to the desk. \\n2. The bed should not be close to the wardrobe. \\n3. The desk should have enough space around it to allow for comfortable work. \\n4. The wardrobe should be accessible without obstruction by the bed or desk. \\n5. Ensure there is sufficient walking space between the bed, desk, and wardrobe. \\n \\nPrompt 3:  \\nFor each of these objects, secondary_objects, tell me all of the considerations and constraints \\nfor its placement within the room that depends only on fixed features in the room like walls, \\nwindows, doors, sockets, etc. (return these as a bullet list for each object). Include practical \\nthings like whether it should be against a wall and what side of the object (one of: left, right, \\nback, front) or if it should be against a wall, or which side should be accessible for use (Most \\nobjects will have an accessible constraint - this would be something like the wardrobe needs \\nto be accessible from the front so that the doors can open, or the bed needs to be accessible \\nfrom the sides - but only give necessary accessible constraints. If an object can have its side \\nagainst something, then don't say its side needs to be accessible e.g. for a nightstand, etc). \\nThe room is described as “a bedroom that is 4m x 5m”. Don't include any constraints that \\ndepend on other objects. Only give these constraints and considerations, no other \\ninformation.  \\n \\nOutput:  \\n### Sleeping: \\n#### Nightstand (0.5m x 0.4m) (2 items) \\n- Can be placed against a wall. \\n \\n### Storage: \\n#### Dresser (1.0m x 0.5m) \\n- Should be placed against a wall. \\n- Front should be accessible for use.\\n\\n--- Page 34 ---\\n### Work: \\n#### Desk Chair (0.6m x 0.6m) \\n- Should not block any doors or windows. \\n- Should be near a wall socket for power if needed (e.g., for a computer). \\n- Should have enough space around it to pull out and sit down (at least 0.6m of free space in \\nfront). \\n \\nPrompt 4:  \\nTell me all of the constraints and considerations between the objects in this list, \\nsecondary_obects, as well as in this list primary_objects. For example, a desk chair should \\nhave its front against the front of the desk, or the left side of one  \\nof the nightstands should be against the right side of the bed, etc.  Be specific with \\nrelationships between objects to include sides (one of: left, right, back, front)  \\nif appropriate, or minimum/maximum distances between objects etc. The room is described \\nas “a bedroom that is 4m x 5m”. Only give the constraints and considerations between \\nobjects, no other information. \\n \\nOutput:  \\n \\n1. **Bed and Nightstands:** \\n   - The left side of one nightstand should be against the right side of the bed. \\n   - The right side of the other nightstand should be against the left side of the bed. \\n   - The nightstands should be positioned so they are aligned with the headboard of the bed. \\n \\n2. **Desk Chair and Desk:** \\n   - The front of the desk chair should be against the front of the desk. \\n   - Ensure there is adequate space behind the desk chair for movement (minimum of 0.5m). \\n \\n3. **Dresser and Wardrobe:** \\n   - The dresser and wardrobe should be positioned in a way that allows for ease of access. \\n   - Maintain at least 0.5m of space in front of both the dresser and wardrobe for access. \\n   - The dresser and wardrobe should not be placed next to each other to avoid crowding. \\n \\n4. **Bed and Dresser:** \\n   - Maintain a minimum distance of 0.5m between the bed and the dresser for ease of \\nmovement and access. \\n \\n5. **Bed and Wardrobe:** \\n   - Maintain a minimum distance of 0.5m between the bed and the wardrobe for ease of \\nmovement and access. \\n \\n6. **Desk and Bed/Nightstands:** \\n   - The desk should be positioned so there is a minimum distance of 0.5m from the bed and \\nnightstands to avoid obstruction. \\n   - The desk should be placed along a wall opposite to or adjacent to the bed to avoid \\nobstruction. \\n \\n7. **Desk and Other Storage (Dresser/Wardrobe):** \\n   - The desk should have a minimum distance of 0.5m from the dresser and wardrobe to \\nallow for ease of movement and access to storage items.\\n\\n--- Page 35 ---\\n**Note:** Ensure that all furniture placement considers the need for adequate circulation \\nspace and ease of access to various parts of the room. \\n \\nPrompt 5:  \\nGiven this list of primary objects: primary_objects, and this list of secondary objects: \\nsecondary_objects, use the file attached to create the objects with the correct parameters. The \\nroom name is: room_name the region names are: regions. \\nThe room is already set up, only add in the objects using the 'create_moving_object' function. \\nEnsure that each objects index is unique and that the indices begin from 0. The objects should \\nbe added in the correct regions. Add in all of the primary objects first. This is the file: \\nfile_contents1. No extra text, only the function calls.

The soft neutral walls and medium oak flooring create a warm and balanced \\nfoundation. Each piece of furniture and accessory has been chosen for its simplicity, \\nelegance, and ability to create a tranquil, aesthetically pleasing bedroom.  \\n \\nConstraint Cleaning  \\nThis prompt is used 4 times:  for the primary individual constraints, for the primary inter-\\nobject constraints, for the secondary individual constraints, and the secondary inter-object \\nconstraints.  \\n \\nPrompt 1: I am going to give you a list of constraints. I want you to merge any similar \\nconstraints and also remove any duplicate constraints. Each constraint should be simplified, \\nso that it is said in the most basic terms. I want you to remove any constraints that are \\ncontradictory e.g. should be near a window AND should be away from a window. If there is \\nan \\\"or\\\" statement in the constraint, choose one of the options. Finally, each bullet constraint \\nshould only specify one constraint. For example if there is a bullet point that says and object \\nshould not block windows and doors, change this into 2 bullets - one for blocking doors, and \\none for blocking windows. Remove any constraints that have if statements, and any \\nthat involve height. If there are constraints for objects to be accessible from all sides that are \\nunnecessary, change them to be which sides you think ARE necessary. If there are constraints \\nwith \\\"or\\\" in them, choose between the options. Return the list of cleaned constraints. Here is \\nthe list of constraints: constraints.  \\n \\nOutput 1:  \\n \\n### Cleaned Constraints:\\n\\n--- Page 40 ---\\n#### Bed (1.5m x 2m) \\n- Should be placed against a wall. \\n- Should not block access to windows. \\n- Should not block access to doors. \\n- Front side should be accessible. \\n- Should allow for at least 60 cm of free space on one side. \\n \\n#### Wardrobe (1.2m x 0.6m) \\n- Should be placed against a wall. \\n- Should not block access to windows. \\n- Should not block access to doors. \\n- Front side should be accessible. \\n- Avoid placing it where it will block electrical sockets. \\n- Ideally placed in a corner. \\n \\n#### Desk (1.2m x 0.6m) \\n- Should be placed against a wall. \\n- Should not block access to windows. \\n- Should not block access to doors. \\n- Front side should be accessible. \\n- Ideally positioned near electrical sockets. \\n- Should not block airflow from vents. \\n \\nOutput 2:  \\n \\nHere are the cleaned and simplified constraints based on your requirements: \\n \\n- The bed should not be close to the desk. \\n- The bed should not be close to the wardrobe. \\n- The desk should have enough space around it to allow for comfortable work. \\n- The wardrobe should be accessible without obstruction by the bed. \\n- The wardrobe should be accessible without obstruction by the desk. \\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between the bed and the desk. \\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between the bed and the wardrobe. \\n- Ensure there is sufficient walking space between the desk and the wardrobe. \\n \\nOutput 3:  \\n \\nHere is the cleaned list of constraints: \\n \\n### Sleeping: \\n#### Nightstand (0.5m x 0.4m) (2 items) \\n- Can be placed against a wall. \\n \\n### Storage: \\n#### Dresser (1.0m x 0.5m) \\n- Should be placed against a wall. \\n- Front should be accessible for use.\\n\\n--- Page 41 ---\\n### Work: \\n#### Desk Chair (0.6m x 0.6m) \\n- Should not block any doors. \\n- Should not block any windows. \\n- Should have enough space around it to pull out and sit down. \\n \\nOutput 4:  \\n \\n**Cleaned Constraints:** \\n \\n1. **Bed and Nightstands:** \\n   - One nightstand should be to the right of the bed. \\n   - One nightstand should be to the left of the bed. \\n   - The nightstands should be aligned with the headboard of the bed. \\n \\n2. **Desk Chair and Desk:** \\n   - The front of the desk chair should be against the front of the desk. \\n   - Ensure there is adequate space behind the desk chair for movement. \\n \\n3. **Dresser and Wardrobe:** \\n   - Maintain at least 0.5m of space in front of the dresser for access. \\n   - Maintain at least 0.5m of space in front of the wardrobe for access. \\n   - The dresser and wardrobe should not be placed next to each other to avoid crowding. \\n \\n4. **Bed and Dresser:** \\n   - Maintain a minimum distance of 0.5m between the bed and the dresser for ease of \\nmovement. \\n \\n5. **Bed and Wardrobe:** \\n   - Maintain a minimum distance of 0.5m between the bed and the wardrobe for ease of \\nmovement. \\n \\n6. **Desk and Bed/Nightstands:** \\n   - The desk should be positioned so there is a minimum distance of 0.5m from the bed and \\nnightstands. \\n   - The desk should be placed along a wall opposite the bed. \\n \\n7. **Desk and Other Storage (Dresser/Wardrobe):** \\n   - The desk should have a minimum distance of 0.5m from the dresser. \\n   - The desk should have a minimum distance of 0.5m from the wardrobe. \\n \\n**General Note:** Ensure that all furniture placement considers the need for adequate \\ncirculation space and ease of access to various parts of the room. \\n \\nTranslation  \\n \\nPrompt 1:\\n\\n--- Page 42 ---\\nGiven the room_name room_name, as well as the primary objects: primary_objects, their \\nindices primary_indices, and these constraints: primary_individual_cons, using the script \\nattached, transform each constraint into a SINGLE function call that will ensure that the \\nprimary objects are set up correctly.
