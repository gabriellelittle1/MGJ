We present HoloFusion, a\\nmethod that combines the best of these approaches to produce high-fidelity,\\nplausible, and diverse 3D samples while learning from a collection of\\nmulti-view 2D images only. The method first generates coarse 3D samples using a\\nvariant of the recently proposed HoloDiffusion generator. Then, it\\nindependently renders and upsamples a large number of views of the coarse 3D\\nmodel, super-resolves them to add detail, and distills those into a single,\\nhigh-fidelity implicit 3D representation, which also ensures view consistency\\nof the final renders. The super-resolution network is trained as an integral\\npart of HoloFusion, end-to-end, and the final distillation uses a new sampling\\nscheme to capture the space of super-resolved signals. We compare our method\\nagainst existing baselines, including DreamFusion, Get3D, EG3D, and\\nHoloDiffusion, and achieve, to the best of our knowledge, the most realistic\\nresults on the challenging CO3Dv2 dataset.\", \"link\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14244v1.pdf\"}, {\"title\": \"HoloDiffusion: Training a 3D Diffusion Model using 2D Images\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion models have emerged as the best approach for generative modeling of\\n2D images. Part of their success is due to the possibility of training them on\\nmillions if not billions of images with a stable learning objective. However,\\nextending these models to 3D remains difficult for two reasons. First, finding\\na large quantity of 3D training data is much more complex than for 2D images.\\nSecond, while it is conceptually trivial to extend the models to operate on 3D\\nrather than 2D grids, the associated cubic growth in memory and compute\\ncomplexity makes this infeasible. We address the first challenge by introducing\\na new diffusion setup that can be trained, end-to-end, with only posed 2D\\nimages for supervision; and the second challenge by proposing an image\\nformation model that decouples model memory from spatial memory. We evaluate\\nour method on real-world data, using the CO3D dataset which has not been used\\nto train 3D generative models before. We show that our diffusion models are\\nscalable, train robustly, and are competitive in terms of sample quality and\\nfidelity to existing approaches for 3D generative modeling.\", \"link\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16509v2.pdf\"}]\u001b[0m\n",
