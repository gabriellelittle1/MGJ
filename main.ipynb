Between then and the 6th June 2020, 33,846\\npeople died and the total number of cases rose to 234,801 [8].\\n23.3% of Italy’s population is over the age of 65 [5], making it\\nthe second oldest population in the world. This may explain\\nwhy Italy seems especially vulnerable. I have modelled Italy’s\\noutbreak using SIRD modelling. Modelling accurate rates of\\ninfection, recovery and death, along with the basic reproduc-\\ntion number, R0, can be quite challenging due to the high\\nproportion of infections that are undetected. The number of\\ninfections has been estimated to be as high as 63 times as large\\nas the number recorded [3].\\nSIRD Modelling\\nSIRD modelling is based on four diﬀerent groups within the\\npopulation: those who are susceptible (S); those who are in-\\nfected (I); those who have recovered (R); and those who have\\ndied (D).\\nThe governing equations of my model are as follows:\\nS + I\\nβ\\n−→2I\\nI\\nγ\\n−→R\\nI\\nδ\\n−→D\\nWhere β is the contact rate, γ is the rate of recovery, and δ is\\nthe rate of death. From these equations, the following system\\nof ODEs can be found and solved [6]:\\ndS\\ndt = −β\\nNSI\\ndI\\ndt = β\\nNSI −(γ + δ)I\\ndR\\ndt = γI\\ndD\\ndt = δI\\nFitting the Model to the Data\\nI used least squares regression from python’s lmﬁt module to\\nﬁt my SIRD model to my data [7]. I began by assuming that\\nmy rates β, γ and δ were all constant. However, after plotting\\nthe results of this model, I quickly realised that my value of β\\nneeded to decrease with time. Therefore, I decided to deﬁne\\nβ(t) as a function instead. I found this function intuitively\\nusing a negative exponential model multiplied by the β value\\nfound. I also assumed that the initial number of susceptible in\\nItaly was equal to the population: 60,461,828 [1]. The results\\nfor recovery and death rates were as follows:\\nγ = 0.0234\\nδ = 0.0064\\nThe following values of β correspond to the start of the data\\nand the end of lockdown:\\n18/02/2020\\nβ = 0.1473\\n14/05/2020\\nβ = 0.0080\\nFrom these values of β we can see that at the end of lockdown,\\nthe infection rate was much lower, as expected, due to much\\nfewer contacts between those in the susceptible group and those\\nin the infected group.\\nR0\\nAn important feature of modelling epidemics is the basic repro-\\nduction number R0. This number is the number of secondary\\ninfections resulting from a single primary infection.

We present HoloFusion, a method that combines the best of these approaches to produce high-fidelity, plausible, and diverse 3D samples while learning from a collection of multi-view 2D images only. The method first generates coarse 3D samples using a variant of the recently proposed HoloDiffusion generator. Then, it independently renders and upsamples a large number of views of the coarse 3D model, super-resolves them to add detail, and distills those into a single, high-fidelity implicit 3D representation, which also ensures view consistency of the final renders. The super-resolution network is trained as an integral part of HoloFusion, end-to-end, and the final distillation uses a new sampling scheme to capture the space of super-resolved signals. We compare our method against existing baselines, including DreamFusion, Get3D, EG3D, and HoloDiffusion, and achieve, to the best of our knowledge, the most realistic results on the challenging CO3Dv2 dataset.', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14244v1.pdf'}, {'title': 'HoloDiffusion: Training a 3D Diffusion Model using 2D Images', 'summary': 'Diffusion models have emerged as the best approach for generative modeling of 2D images.

However, extending these models to 3D remains difficult for two reasons. First, finding a large quantity of 3D training data is much more complex than for 2D images. Second, while it is conceptually trivial to extend the models to operate on 3D rather than 2D grids, the associated cubic growth in memory and compute complexity makes this infeasible. We address the first challenge by introducing a new diffusion setup that can be trained, end-to-end, with only posed 2D images for supervision; and the second challenge by proposing an image formation model that decouples model memory from spatial memory. We evaluate our method on real-world data, using the CO3D dataset which has not been used to train 3D generative models before. We show that our diffusion models are scalable, train robustly, and are competitive in terms of sample quality and fidelity to existing approaches for 3D generative modeling.', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16509v2.pdf'}], 'pdf_texts': {'Poster.pdf': '--- Page 1 ---\\nForecasting coronavirus in Italy with SIRD modelling\\nGabrielle Littlefair\\nOral: https://imperial.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7d1f1304-438b-40e3-b586-abd7011a8903\\nObjectives\\n• Find estimates for the contact, death and recovery rates\\nof coronavirus in Italy using least squares regression.\\n• Identify any issues with the model and data.\\n• Extrapolate the model to see how coronavirus may\\nprogress in the upcoming months.\\nIntroduction\\nThe ﬁrst case of coronavirus in Italy was reported on the 31st\\nJanuary 2020. Between then and the 6th June 2020, 33,846\\npeople died and the total number of cases rose to 234,801 [8].\\n23.3% of Italy’s population is over the age of 65 [5], making it\\nthe second oldest population in the world. This may explain\\nwhy Italy seems especially vulnerable. I have modelled Italy’s\\noutbreak using SIRD modelling. Modelling accurate rates of\\ninfection, recovery and death, along with the basic reproduc-\\ntion number, R0, can be quite challenging due to the high\\nproportion of infections that are undetected. The number of\\ninfections has been estimated to be as high as 63 times as large\\nas the number recorded [3].\\nSIRD Modelling\\nSIRD modelling is based on four diﬀerent groups within the\\npopulation: those who are susceptible (S); those who are in-\\nfected (I); those who have recovered (R); and those who have\\ndied (D).\\nThe governing equations of my model are as follows:\\nS + I\\nβ\\n−→2I\\nI\\nγ\\n−→R\\nI\\nδ\\n−→D\\nWhere β is the contact rate, γ is the rate of recovery, and δ is\\nthe rate of death. From these equations, the following system\\nof ODEs can be found and solved [6]:\\ndS\\ndt = −β\\nNSI\\ndI\\ndt = β\\nNSI −(γ + δ)I\\ndR\\ndt = γI\\ndD\\ndt = δI\\nFitting the Model to the Data\\nI used least squares regression from python’s lmﬁt module to\\nﬁt my SIRD model to my data [7]. I began by assuming that\\nmy rates β, γ and δ were all constant. However, after plotting\\nthe results of this model, I quickly realised that my value of β\\nneeded to decrease with time. Therefore, I decided to deﬁne\\nβ(t) as a function instead. I found this function intuitively\\nusing a negative exponential model multiplied by the β value\\nfound. I also assumed that the initial number of susceptible in\\nItaly was equal to the population: 60,461,828 [1]. The results\\nfor recovery and death rates were as follows:\\nγ = 0.0234\\nδ = 0.0064\\nThe following values of β correspond to the start of the data\\nand the end of lockdown:\\n18/02/2020\\nβ = 0.1473\\n14/05/2020\\nβ = 0.0080\\nFrom these values of β we can see that at the end of lockdown,\\nthe infection rate was much lower, as expected, due to much\\nfewer contacts between those in the susceptible group and those\\nin the infected group.\\nR0\\nAn important feature of modelling epidemics is the basic repro-\\nduction number R0. This number is the number of secondary\\ninfections resulting from a single primary infection. The reason\\nthis value is so important is that it is an indication of whether\\nthe disease will die out (R0 \\< 1), or if it will become an en-\\ndemic (R0 \\> 1) [4].

It represents the rate at which infected individuals recover and become immune or are removed from the infectious population. Understanding the recovery rate helps in predicting the course of an epidemic and in designing effective intervention strategies.\\n\\n[[Key Definitions]]\\n- **Recovery Rate (\\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\))**: The rate at which infected individuals recover and are removed from the infectious population.\\n- **Infectious Period**: The average duration of time an individual remains infectious.\\n- **Basic Reproduction Number (\\\\( R_0 \\\\))**: The expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infection in a completely susceptible population.\\n\\n[[Relevant Formulas]]\\n**Basic Reproduction Number**\\n\\\\( R_0 = \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\gamma} \\\\)\\n\\n**Change in Infected Population**\\n\\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\\\beta \\\\times S \\\\times I - \\\\gamma \\\\times I \\\\)\\nwhere \\\\( S \\\\) is the number of susceptible individuals and \\\\( I \\\\) is the number of infectious individuals.\\n\\n[[Examples]]\\n1. **Seasonal Flu Recovery**: During a flu outbreak, health officials track the recovery rate to understand how quickly individuals are recovering and how this affects the overall spread of the disease. A higher recovery rate indicates that individuals are recovering quickly, reducing the number of infectious individuals.\\n\\n2. **COVID-19 Recovery Monitoring**: In the context of COVID-19, understanding the recovery rate helps in predicting hospital resource needs and in assessing the effectiveness of treatment protocols.\\n\\n[[Reflective Questions]]\\n1. How does the recovery rate \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) influence the dynamics of an epidemic?\\n2. Why is it important to accurately estimate the recovery rate in epidemiological models?\\n3. How can changes in the recovery rate \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) affect the basic reproduction number \\\\( R_0 \\\\)?\\n4. What factors might influence the recovery rate \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) in different populations or settings?\\n5. How can public health interventions be designed to improve the recovery rate \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) during an outbreak?'}]}\u001b[0m\n",

Initially, two papers were identified and downloaded using the ArXivTool. The PDFReaderTool extracted full texts, which were then used to create a Page Summary subpage. Core mathematical and scientific concepts were extracted, focusing on generalizable topics like SIRD Modelling and Least Squares Regression. The TopicSelectorTool refined these topics, and Notion pages were created for them. Finally, quizzes were developed for each topic, completing the learning pathway.\u001b[0m\n"
